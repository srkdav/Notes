The only applciable modifiers for top level classes are 
public, 
default,
abstract,
final ,
strictfp. 

But, for inner classes, the applicable modifiers are on top + 
private,
protected,
static. Total 8!
Top level very important.

Access specifiers vs access modifiers : 
public protected private default : specifiers

static, final, abstract etc : modifiers

But this in C++. In java, all are modifiers. (12 of them).

1)public class:
access from anywhere.

2)default class:
only within package - package level access.

3)final modifier:
class,methods and variable can be final.
like child can override parent class's methods. But parent can say its method is final and child cannot override it.

if parent has 10 methods, child class can have 5 on its own. extended from parent means 15 methods for child.
But we cant extend if parent class is final. Then no inheritance for the parent class. Its the last and cant be extnded.
Every method in final class is final by default. 

4)Abstract modifier:
abs is for class and methods.
